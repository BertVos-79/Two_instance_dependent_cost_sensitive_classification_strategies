# Notebooks for Master's Thesis Research (2024)

The Notebooks in this Repository belong to research carried out in the context of my Master’s Thesis (2024). They are divided into three components:

## Components:
1. **24 illustrations of decision boundaries** for different scenarios of cost-sensitive classification to illustrate the problem statement in the Thesis.
2. **Results for functional misspecification metrics** for a linear model like logistic regression for two sets of datasets to develop the problem statement in the Thesis:
   - A first set for four datasets used in a study on class-dependent cost-sensitive learning by Dmoschoswki et al. (2010).
   - A second set for six datasets used in my Master’s Thesis on instance-dependent cost-sensitive learning.
3. **Rankings of the degree of functional misspecification** of a linear model for the datasets contained in each of both sets.
